### So you've made it to my profile

Let's get to know each other, then! I'm a software engineer whose primary focus is on building **cool** things. Technically, my entire career has been spent as a full-stack engineer and I have put much of that time focusing on building out stable, secure, and distributed backend systems. I prefer to focus more on the cool outcomes though rather than specific domains or technologies. Seeing something pushed to prod and measuring the impact it has in the real world for real users and knowing that I played a part in that is the best reward.

While I love to build cool things, I also have a passion for application security. My personality is one that loves to poke, sometimes to an obsessive fault. I love to learn and understand how things work - what better way to understand how it can be improved, reproduced, or augmented to fit different needs? A lot of what I feel are major accomplishments in my career are discovering vulnerabilities in the applications around me (a result of the previously mentioned poking) and working with teams to assess their risk and come up with mitigating solutions. 

I have recently discovered that I like to coach or mentor other engineers and have taken on that role with my current employer. I do not think that I am particularly good at it, but I enjoy the opportunity it gives me to grow my interpersonal, communication, and introspection skills. 

### Interests

* I am a huge fan of C# and the .NET ecosystem
* I am passionate about application security and advocating for responsible engineering practices
* I love the idea of Rust and I am actively learning it, though haven't been able to introduce it into a professional environment (yet)
* I feel very satisfied coming up with simple solutions to everyday annoyances
* Most of my time is spent coming up with ideas for neat projects, starting them, learning a lot, and then not finishing them. I guess that's my favorite hobby? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Ask me about...

What I'm actively working on! I would give a list, but because I am always thinking of new projects to start, I'm afraid that the list would change more frequently than I care to keep this updated. If you don't care about that, then you can ask me about anything else, really. I'm a pretty open book.
